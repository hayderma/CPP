# AERONAV OFFLINE TESTING SYSTEM 
Small Scale Offline Algebra Quiz Program
This program Takes basic information from the user (i.e. name), and starts a commandline-based algebra quiz of few questions.

When the user is done, a score report will be generated in a text file, in the same folder where executable program is. the report also contains the incorrect answers and their corresponding correct answer key.

Sample text files of report are attached (answers were chosen randomly without thinking the questions through)

Note that I worked on this program in 2015, it is not complete as the way it was originally intended, and I never modified it since then.
